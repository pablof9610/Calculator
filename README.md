# How it works

Basically, the code works with the value of the label master, which is updated as the buttons are used (numbers, operations, etc.)

When i press "1" for example, this value is set to 1; so when i press "+", this value will be storaged in a variable that is know as bfnumber (before number), a global variable will storage the value that represents this operation "+" (like "1"), and the value of the label is returned to "0", waiting for a new call to change this number. When this other number is typed, the program have two numbers and a operation to calculate clicking or not in "=".
